=== BEGIN QUOTE ===
Nature to all things fixed the limits fit,
And wisely curbed proud man's pretending wit.
As on the land while here the ocean gains,
In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains;
Thus in the soul while memory prevails,
The solid power of understanding fails;
Where beams of warm imagination play,
The memory's soft figures melt away.
		-- Alexander Pope (on runtime bounds checking?)

The lady was using a power strip to plug her computer and other devices into. 
Windows was completely frozen, and she was unable to shut down the machine by 
using the power button. She mentioned the power strip, so I told her to flip it 
off. She said, &quot;Ok, I gave it the finger. I feel better.&quot;

'You have the right to remain silent,' he [Carrot] said. 'You have the right not to injure yourself falling down the steps on the way to the cells. You have the right not to jump out of high windows. You do not have to say anything, you see, but anything you do say, well, I have to take it down and it might be used as evidence.'
(Guards! Guards!)
