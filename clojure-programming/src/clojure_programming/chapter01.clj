"
Namespaces are Clojures unit of code modularity.

A 'namespace' is fundamentally a dynamic mapping between symbols and 
either vars and Java classes.

Vars (a reference type) are mutable storage that can hold any value.

They are defined using the 'def' special form.

Never define 'vars' in a funtion body, only at the top level.

let is implicitly used int 'fn' and 'defn' to bind parmeters in the
local scope.

- loop and recure are special forms that override immutability.
- reference type can be used to override immutability but have special
  semantics.

Let bindings provide destructuring at.

[[:subsection {:title "Destructuring - let" :tag "page 28" }]]
"
Most Clojure funtions are based around sequential and map data structures.
This allows functions and data structures to be trivially composed.
One challenge is to access$ the data in these structures.
"
(def v [42 "foo" 99.2 [5 12]])

(facts "a couple of approaches"
  (fact (first v) => 42)
  (fact (second v) => "foo")

  (fact (nth v 2) => 99.2)
  (fact (v 2) => 99.2)
  (fact (.get v 2) => 99.2))
"
'first' 'second' 'last' are standard functions for accessing
sequential values.
'nth' allows you to pick any value using an index.
Vectors are functions of there indexes.
Clojure sequential collections implement the java.util.List interface (.get)

Accessing deeper structures are more complicated
"
(facts "this is complicated"
  (fact (+ (first v) (v 2)) => 141.2)
  (fact (+ (first v) (first (last v))) => 47))
"
Clojure destructuring provides a more concise syntax
Destructuring syntax of 'let' also works for (fn defn loop ...).

Destructuring comes in two forms Sequntial and Map.
"
"Sequential destructuring works with many types of collections:
  list vector seq, java.util.List (ArrayList LinkedList), 
  java arrays, Strings.
"
(fact "basic example"
  (let [[x y z] v]
    (+ x z))
  => 141.2)

(fact "this is equivalent"
  (let [x (nth v 0)
        y (nth v 1)
        z (nth v 2)]
    (+ x z))
  => 141.2)

"Destructuring can be nested"

(fact "nested destructuring"
  (let [[x _ _ [y z]] v]
    (+ x y z))
  => 59)

"
Extra-positional sequential values
& gathers up the rest of values that lay beyond the values in 
the destructuring form.
"
(fact "extra-positional"
  (let [[x & rest] v]
    rest)
  => '("foo" 99.2 [5 12]))

"
Map destructuring 
similar to sequential destructuring.
It works with hash-maps array-maps records, anything that implements
java.util.Map, anything that is supported by 'get' vectors Strings Arrays
