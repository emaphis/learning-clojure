- Indexed

"

[[:subsection {:title "Collection Abstraction --  page: 87"}]]

"
All data structures implement the 'collection' abstraction:
- 'conj' to add an item to a collection.
- 'seq' to get the sequence interface of a collection.
- 'count' to get the number of item in a collection.
- 'empty' to get an empty instance of the collection.
- '=' to determine the value equality of the collection.

Each of these operations are polymorphic on the collection and maintain the
collections semantics.

[[:subsection {:title "Sequences Abstraction --  page: 89"}]]
"
'sequence' is an abstraction that defines an interface for obtaining or
 traversing a sequential view of a collection or successive values of some
 computation.

They involve a few operations over the collection interface:
"
"
- 'seq' produces a sequence over it's argument.
- 'first', 'rest', and 'next' provide a way to consume sequences
- 'lazy-seq' produce a lazy sequence given an expression to evaluate.

'seq'able types include: Clojure and Java collections, Java maps, Java
CharSequences (including Strings), Java Iterables, Arrays, nil (null), anything
clojure.lang.Seq.

"
(facts "some examples:"
  (fact "a string"
    (seq "Clojure")
    => '(\C \l \o \j \u \r \e))
  (fact "a map"
    (seq {:a 5 :b 6})
    => '([:b 6] [:a 5]))
  (fact "a Java array list"
    (seq (java.util.ArrayList. (range 5)))
    => '(0 1 2 3 4))
  (fact "array"
    (seq (into-array ["Clojure" "Programming"]))
    => '("Clojure" "Programming"))
  (fact "the 'seq' of 'nil' or empty collection is 'nil'..."
    (seq [])
    => nil)
  (fact "..."
    (seq nil)
    => nil))

"
Many functions that work on collections call 'seq' on them implicitly:"

(fact "so we don't have to call 'seq' on a string to use it as a collection:"
  (map str "Clojure")
  => '("C" "l" "o" "j" "u" "r" "e"))
(fact
  (set "Programming")
  => #{\a \g \i \m \n \o \P \r})

"
The fundamental operations for traversing sequences are: 'first', 'rest' and
 'next:
"
(fact
  (first "Clojure")
  => \C)
(fact
  (rest "Clojure")
  => '(\l \o \j \u \r \e))
(fact
  (next "Clojure")
  => '(\l \o \j \u \r \e))

"
'rest' underlies the the implementation of variadic functions

'rest' and 'next' differ on the way that they treat sequences containing 0 or 1
 values:
"
(facts "'rest' vs. 'next'"
  (fact "'rest' of collection of one item returns empty collection"
    (rest [1])
    => '())
  (fact "'next' of collection of one item returns 'nil'"
    (next [1])
    => nil)
  (fact "'rest' empty collection is an empty collection"
    (rest nil)
    => ())
  (fact "'next' of empty collection is a 'nil; "
    (next nil)
    => nil))

"'rest' returns an empty sequence, while 'next' returns a 'nil'..."

(fact "... so, this identity is always true"
  (= (next ..any..)
     (seq (rest ..any..)))
  => truthy)

"
This makes it possible to generate sequences lazily
"

"
Sequences are not iterators:
"
(doseq [x (range 3)]
  (println x))
;;=> 0
;;=> 1
;;=> 3
"
remember that the seq just created is immutable, so the value can't be changed
like mutable stateful iterators:"

(let [r (range 3)
      rst (rest r)]   ;; the 'derivative' rst
  (prn (map str rst))
  (prn (map #(+ 100 %) r))  ;; 'r' is immutable
  (prn (conj r -1) (conj rst 42)))
;;=> ("1" "2")
;;=> (100 101 102)
;;=> (-1 - 1 2) (42 1 2)

"
As the products returned are immutable, they can be safely reused."


"
Sequences are not lists:

- 'count' on a 'seq' can be costly.
- contents of a 'seq' may be calculated lazily and realized when they are
   accessed.
- the computation producing a lazy 'seq' may be infinite, therefore uncountable.

lists track there length, so 'count' is cheap.
"

  )

"
Creating 'seqs':

You don't normally create 'seq's they are normally returned by functions but, but
 you can with 'cons' and 'list*'.

'cons' takes two arguments, a value that serves as the head and another
 collection that serves as the tail.
"

'cons' always prepends to it's collection even if that is inefficient
 unlike 'conj':"
(fact "Yuck!"
  (cons :a [:b :c :d])

'list*' produces a sequence with any number of heads:"

(facts "these are equivalent:"

since 'cons' and 'list*' don't force realization of a values in s 'seq' these
